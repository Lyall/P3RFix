## Installation
- Grab the latest release of P3RFix from [here.](https://github.com/Lyall/P3RFix/releases)
- Extract the contents of the release zip in to the the game's binary folder.<br />(e.g. "**XboxGames\Persona 3 Reload\Content**" for Xbox/MS Store or "**steamapps\common\P3R**" for Steam).

<summary>If you want to use Reloaded II mods alongside P3RFix</summary>
  
*This applies to both Windows and Steam Deck/Linux*

Note: Reloaded II **might not work** if you use the **Game Pass/MS Store version of P3R** (see [this page](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/17165) if you want help with that) so it's recommended to only follow these steps if you are using the Steam version. 

Before starting, make sure to **delete any P3RFix files** inside of the game's files **if you have already have used this fix** previously (*P3RFix.ini*, *P3RFix.asi*, *dsound.ini* and *dsound.dll*)

To make sure P3RFix loads alongside any Reloaded II mods you are using, follow these steps:

- Set up Reloaded II and enable any mods you want as per the instructions on [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/17156).
- In Reloaded II go to *Edit Application*, *Advanced Tools & Options*, *Deploy ASI Loader*.

- Once this is done, open the game's binary folder (e.g. "**steamapps\common\P3R\P3R\Binaries\Win64**" for Steam).
- You should see a *scripts* folder which Reloaded II created when deploying the ASI Loader.
- Move *P3RFix.asi* into this folder.
- You should now be able to start the game and see both P3RFix and Reloaded II mods working.

## Configuration
- See **P3RFix.ini** to adjust settings for the fix.

## Known Issues
Please report any issues you see.
This list will contain bugs which may or may not be fixed.

- Some screen fades/transitions may not span the screen at non-16:9 resolutions.
- If you skip intro to the load save menu, then back out, you will softlock the game.
- Disabling pause on focus loss while using m/kbd can cause issues with mouse capture. Enter a menu first to release the cursor. ([#35](https://github.com/Lyall/P3RFix/issues/35))
