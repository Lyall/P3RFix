## Known Issues
Please report any issues you see.
This list will contain bugs which may or may not be fixed.

- Some screen fades/transitions may not span the screen at non-16:9 resolutions.
- If you skip intro to the load save menu, then back out, you will softlock the game.
- Disabling pause on focus loss while using m/kbd can cause issues with mouse capture. Enter a menu first to release the cursor. ([#35](https://github.com/Lyall/P3RFix/issues/35))
