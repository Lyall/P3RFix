[P3RFix Parameters]
; Injection delay in milliseconds.
InjectionDelay = 1000

;;;;;;;;;; General ;;;;;;;;;;

[Custom Resolution]
; Enter your chosen resolution to override the game's resolution.
; You can leave these at 0 if you want your desktop resolution used instead.
; Note that borderless mode will always use your desktop resolution no matter what you set here.
Enabled = true
Width = 0
Height = 0

[Intro Skip]
; Skip all caution/warning + network screens.
SkipLogos = true
; 1 = Opening movie, 2 = Main menu, 3 = Load save menu
SkipTo = 2

[Uncap 60FPS Menus]
; Menu FPS is capped to 60, set to true to uncap to target framerate.
Enabled = true

[Pause on Focus Loss]
; Set to false to stop the game from pausing when alt+tabbed.
Enabled = true

;;;;;;;;;; Ultrawide/Narrower Fixes ;;;;;;;;;;

[Fix HUD]
; Unconstrains HUD.
Enabled = true

[Fix Aspect Ratio]
; Fixes aspect ratio.
Enabled = true

[Fix FOV]
; Fixes FOV.
Enabled = true

;;;;;;;;;; Graphical Tweaks ;;;;;;;;;;

[Screen Percentage]
; Overrides screen percentage (a.k.a render scale).
; Set to >100 for downsampling or <100 to upsample.
Enabled = false
Value = 100

[Render Texture Resolution]
; Increases resoluton for TextureRenderTarget2D objects such as character models in menus etc.
; Leave multiplier at 1 to use the automatically calculated resolution multiplier, or adjust above or below 1 to supersample/undersample further.
; Note that increasing this multiplier beyond 1 may cause hitching or performance issues.
Enabled = true
Multiplier = 1

;;;;;;;;;; Experimental ;;;;;;;;;;

[FPS Cap]
; WARNING: This is still considered experimental and may break voice lines or certain timings. Disable this if you run in to any issues.
; Set to true to enable adjustable FPS cap value.
; Note that this will override UncapMenuFPS.
AdjustFPSCap = false
Framerate = 120

[Mouse Fix]
; Relatively untested fix for the stupid smooth camera when using mouse controls. Disable this if you run into any weird camera movement
; Makes mouse camera movement act more like a normal 3rd person game (e.g. P5R)
; You likely aren't making any FPS trickshots with it but it's better than it was
Enabled = false
; Dynamically disables the camera fix when using a controller (or some input device that isn't a mouse)
; This should work even if you switch back and forth (for some reason)
; Any detected mouse input will always override the gamepad, however. Unlike the original game where gamepad camera movement overrides mouse camera movement
; Disabling this will likely break gamepad support entirely
IgnoreGamepad = true
; Mouse X and Y (Yaw and Pitch) movements will be multiplied by these respectively
; Basically replaces the mouse sensitivity option because that's broken now
; Negative values can be used to invert the mouse, if you want that
MouseMultiplierX = 1.0
MouseMultiplierY = 1.0
